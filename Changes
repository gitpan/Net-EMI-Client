Revision history for Perl extension Net::EMI::Client.

1.00  24-Feb-2003
	   - First release of this module.

1.01  25-Feb-2003
      - Updated the Makefile.PL file to reflect module dependencies.

1.02  14-May-2003
      - Made sure the transaction counter, which can hold no more than two digits,
        will never go beyond 99.
      - Introduced a timeout while waiting for a ACK/NACK response from the SMSC.
        Note, that the timeout depends on the alarm() function, which unfortunately
        is not implemented on all systems.
      - Made sure that when methods are called in void context, they will return undef.
